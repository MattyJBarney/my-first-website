# My very first web Page

## Welcome!
### Project Summary

##### I have used this project to get to grips with the Cloud9 interface, along with grasping the
##### basics of the CUI and git coding systems. 
##### I have made a simple website comprising 3 pages consisting of links to other sites.
##### Utilising Cloud9, or specifically, git and GitHub - I've managed to turn a local repository into a remote one.
##### I know am able to remote link files from Cloud9 interfaces to gitHub remote repositories using git commands!

# Hooray!?!?
